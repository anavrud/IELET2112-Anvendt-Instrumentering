## Course Overview

The objective of this course is to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the design, analysis, and implementation of modern instrumentation systems. The course covers sensor technologies, measurement system design, and practical data acquisition and processing using software tools such as LabVIEW and MATLAB

### Key Topics

- Design of general measurement systems, including sensors and data acquisition chains  
- Analysis and interpretation of static characteristics and measurement accuracy  
- Overview of sensor technologies and their behavior  
- Construction of complete instrumentation systems  
- Development of virtual instruments for measurement and control  
- Use of data acquisition devices (e.g., **myDAQ**)  
- Programming for data acquisition and data presentation in LabVIEW and MATLAB  

The course combines theoretical lectures with hands-on laboratory exercises and project work. Students develop practical skills in constructing instrumentation systems and analyzing sensor data, preparing them for real-world applications.
